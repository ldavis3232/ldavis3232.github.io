	<strong><u>Introduction of Topic&amp; Research Question</u></strong></h3>
<p>The Outlook on Life Surveys is the most interesting study to me. I am particularly interested in self-identified political orientation. I noticed that the questions about political orientation appeared normally distributed. Specifically, question &ldquo;<em>W1_C2</em>&rdquo; which asked respondents to rate themselves on a 7 point scale of extremely liberal to extremely conservative. In my personal experience, I have found it common that people with similar socio-economic backgrounds share similar political orientations. I am most interested in the association of political orientation and socio-economic traits. I will treat &ldquo;<em>W1_C2</em>&rdquo; (liberal to conservative scale) as my target variable. I will include other variables reflecting socio-economic traits such as income, ethnicity, class, etc. &nbsp;As a secondary topic I am interested in the association of racial attitudes and socio-economic traits. Again, my personal experience I have found it common that people with similar socio-economic traits have similar racial attitudes. I define &ldquo;racial attitudes&rdquo; as beliefs and perceptions of racial groups. &nbsp;Subsequently, I have developed a personal codebook that includes</p>
<h3>
	<strong><u>Literature Review &amp; Hypothesis </u></strong></h3>
<p>There is an abundance of scholarly research on political orientation in relation to socio-economic traits. There is larger amount of scholarly research on racial attitudes&nbsp; in relation to &nbsp;socio-economic traits. A number of&nbsp; studies have attempted to discover the link between social status or &ldquo;class&rdquo; and political attitudes . My first 3 articles reference below investigate this link in various ways for example,&nbsp; &ldquo;<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2090825">Status Consistency and Political Attitudes</a>&rdquo; is centered around a class theory &nbsp;&ldquo;Status Consistency&rdquo;&nbsp; and it ability to predict political attitudes such as political orientation. In contrast, &ldquo;Impact of class on political attitudes&rdquo; is a testing a theory but analytically investigating the link between class and political attitude through survey analysis. &nbsp;&nbsp;After reviewing a number of scholarly works on political orientation and socio-economic traits, I hypothesize that socio-economic traits do strongly influence political orientation. In regards to my second topic, I hypothesize that socio-economic traits do strongly influence racial attitudes.</p>
